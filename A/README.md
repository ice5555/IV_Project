# PlanA - Data Analysis and Visualization

This project contains `PlanA.ipynb`, a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization. It utilizes `pandas` for data processing and `altair` for visualization.



## Installation

Before running this project, ensure you have installed the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## How to Run

### Option 1: Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. Download the Airbnb dataset from Kaggle:

2. To run the notebook locally, use the following command:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

Then, open `PlanA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the code.

### Option 2: Viewing the HTML File
